# PythonVideoPlayer

This is just a random project ide I had at 3am. Its not finished but its somewhat working.

The idea is that you and your friends all have the same video file, the one decides to be the host. 
The host will send their timestamps to each of you friends so you all can watch the video together. 
You need to have vlc installed to use this.
